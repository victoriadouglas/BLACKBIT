# I am a non-binary illustrator from Columbus, Ohio.

I live at the intersection of hard science fiction that takes itself too seriously, and dark humor that doesn’t take itself seriously enough. I don’t like labels, or neat little boxes.

# So what’s your deal?

My work is an explosive cocktail of pop culture, digital technique, and nihilistic indulgence. Skulls are cool, art is dead, and social media makes me sad. I drown myself with bold colors, shallow statements, and a relentless pursuit of the A E S T H E T I C. I hide behind the percieved quality of my work as a defense mechanism, but I can own that.

I’ve won a few awards, been featured in a few publications, worked for some amazing clients ranging from the United States Air Force, to masters of martial arts, to japanese skill toy manufacturers. I truly love being able to make projects come to life, and I pride myself on attention to detail and high production quality.

# What is Blackbit?

Blackbit is a sandbox for me to play in. I’m the architect, and I’m constantly expanding it’s scope and definition. Today it might be a collection of science fiction short stories, tomorrow it might be a solo gallery show. Stick around and watch the journey.

# What’s a kendama?

I thought you would never ask. Kendama is a japanese cup and ball that’s made a huge resurgence in the past decade; and I ​love​ it. It’s my meditation, my daily relaxation and escape from the monotony. It’s my constant reminder that we never get anywhere without failing a hundred times first. If I can hone a new stall, then I can conquer the world. That’s my kendama soapbox, and I totally recommend it to anyone who needs a new hobby.

# Outside of work?

When I’m not working on the next big thing in the studio, or slaying kendama, you’ll find me knee deep in a good book, or attached to my favorite Nintendo brand gaming console. I make music under the radar, but don't look here for a soundcloud link. I’ve been in love with the city of Columbus since I moved there in 2018 with my wife. Samantha has been my biggest supporter; in both my career and in my life. I couldn’t do any of this without her.

Carpe Diem. Let’s go smash some dinnerplates to pieces together.
